MASTER CROCK MULTIPLAYER CARD GAME

This is the back end of the app, you can find the frontend [here](https://github.com/ujLevente/java-ee-mastercrock-frontend).<br />

Technologies used:
- Lombok<br />
- Postgres<br />
- Spring Boot<br />
- Eureka
- Zuul
- React
- ORM: JPA(Hybernate)<br />

The app makes possible to make game lobbies or join your friend's, the online gameplay achieved with websockets. This is a learning project for developing skills in microservice architecture design, the application is relatively small and the game logic is simple, so this architectural style is a bit "overkill".
